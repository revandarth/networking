Many popular Web services use CDNs to host their content closer to users and thus improve page load times. While this model’s success is beyond question, it has its limits: for users with poor last-mile latency even to a nearby CDN node, the many RTTs needed to fetch a Web page add up to large delays. Thus, in this experiment, we explore a complementary model of speeding up Web page delivery—a content gathering network (CGN), whereby users establish their own geo-distributed presence, and use these points of presence to proxy content for them. In this experiment, we load a set of Web pages both with and without using CGN and record the Web page load times.
After you start the script (sudo ./run_cgn.sh) located at /home/mooc/cgn, the UI lets you provide the following information:
1. Your location
2. Download bandwidth
3. Upload bandwidth
4. ISP name
5. ISP charges per month
6. Experiment runtime (10-60 minutes)
The above information is sent to our servers automatically. We also log and send your IP address to our servers.
As you run the experiment, each Web page is loaded multiple times (under various configurations) and the following information is posted to our servers after each page load:
1. URL of the Web page
2. Web page load time
3. 80% visual completion time
4. 90% visual completion time
5. Visual correctness information
6. Flags to identify the experimental setup and configuration
The dataset, i.e, the set of URLs have been curated to ensure (to the best of our knowledge) that there is no politically sensitive, religiously sensitive or pornographic content. Nevertheless, check the list of URLs the interactive script shows you before agreeing to run the experiment.
Thank you for your interest in participating in this experiment.

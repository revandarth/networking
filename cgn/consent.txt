The measurement script that you will run aims to measure the load times and visual
completion times of web pages. A subset from a curated list of 500 Web pages will be 
used for the experiments and the exact list of pages to be used will be displayed during the test. 
We will ask you 
  * your location (country, state, city), 
  * the type of your broadband service, 
  * download and upload speeds, 
  * the price of your Internet service, and,
  * your ISP. 
  
Your location will enable us to compare latency measurements across different 
parts of the world. Your public IP address will be collected for this purpose 
as well. Type of your Internet service will enable us to see how different 
connection types affect latency. The price, and advertised download and upload 
speeds will help us investigate how / whether these Internet service parameters 
translate into lower latency. 
For the measurements, the following tools/utilities will be used:
Mozilla Firefox: This will be used to load Web pages headlessly.
ping / pyping: This will be used to check your network connectivity.
python imaging library / pyscreenshot: These will be used to record frames rendered by 
firefox periodically to analyze the visual completion of Web pages.
When the test script is run, it will retrieve the list of Web pages to be 
used. Numbered output folders will be created to temporarily store the output files
for each url. 
Each generated file will be uploaded immediately.
You DO NOT HAVE TO send any output files manually.
